A study on the structural, wear, and corrosion properties of a CoCuFeNiMo high-entropy alloy. 
The alloy exhibited segregation of Cu, attributed to positive mixing enthalpy. 
The coefficient of friction exhibited stability under lower loads but fluctuated under higher loads. 
Wear rates increased linearly with applied loads, indicating a direct relationship between load and wear properties. 
The worn surfaces displayed characteristics of mild abrasivewear, with delaminations, plowing, and abrasive wear tracks. 
Pitting corrosion was observed, and the corrosion process was explained as the attack of Cl- ions leading to galvanic 
corrosion between different phases.The first high-entropy alloys were created by Cantor et al. [1] as trary, 
the CoCuFeNi high entropy alloy is capable of forming two CoCrFeNiMn and CoCrCuFeNiAlx. Additional elements, such as 
Al, Mn, Mo, and Nb, aredisfavoring the Cu element. The role of Cu in high entropy alloys re- frequently introduced 
into high-endurance alloys to enhance their strength is unclear.The addition of Cu can often tronic industries because
they have already proven better tribologicalform secondary phases such as Cu-rich FCC, L12 [3,6]. The quaternary and 
corrosion resistance than conventional alloys. In addition, it has been reported that they can be produced with
different fabrication techniques.The wear properties of the alloy were confirmed in contact withTiZrHfNb-based 
RHEAs. The alloy can effectively improve the corrosion and wear 4140 stainless steel at dry condition using a pin-on
disc machine. It has also been found that AlCoCrFeNi HEA has better wear resistance.Wang et al. [17] studied the 
tribocorrosion behavior of AlCoCrFeNi2.1 high entropy alloy. The alloy maintains high.hardness (>197 HV) up to 
900 ◦C. The wear rates of the alloy increased monotonically from room temperature to 900.C. Dual Cu-poor FCC1 and 
Cu-richCu method and applied laser remelting process to regulate the micro-FCC2 were detected in the 
Cu28.36Ni22.32Fe19.12Co15.17Cr12.26Mo2.77 structure.. The AlCoCrFeNiTax alloys had typical dendritic morphology and 
were prepared by the plasma arc additive manufacturing. Hardness and wear resistance of. (CoCuFeNi)100-xMox 
(x =10, 15, 19, and 25at. %) alloys improved by increasing Ta content. In this study, only equiatomic. CoCuFeNiMo 
alloy was created by removing Cr and Mn from CoCr FeNiMn (Cantor alloy) and.adding Cu and Mo instead. The alloy was 
melted in a water-cooled Cu crucible with a W electrode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with the 
radiation source CuKα radiation in the 2θ range.The hardness of the Mo-containing phase is highest while the hardness 
of Cu-produced by arc melting, have only a single FCC solid solution phase, rich phase is lowest. Shun et al. [24]’s 
study, Mo0 and Mo0.3 alloys among the CoCrFe- taken from 5 different points are given in Table 1. Bae microhardness 
value of the (CoCuFeNi)75Mo25 alloy is 518 HV. As a loads as a function of time under dry sliding is shown in Fig. 4.

melting.The microstructure of CoCuFeNiMo high entropy alloys by SEM is in the friction coefficient under 50N load up 
to approximately 750sec. Cu decomposes structure of the alloy, crack formations on the worn surface, oxidation or from 
others. Cu segregates delamination layers formation [29]. Since there was no change in phase.and does not mix with Co, 
Fe and Ni in this alloy, no effect can be considered.The friction coefficient of the CoCuFeNiMo alloy increased as the
load amount increased. Cu is appearance of wear debris, oxide layer and local cracks on the surface of the alloy 
(Cu-rich FCC2 phase). On the other hand, spectrum 9 and the alloy may cause this fluctuation. Similar EDX results 
with three different compositions are seen in study systematically examining the effects of Mo content on the CoCuFeNi
100-xMox at% (x =15, 19, and 25) alloys.wear properties of the alloy. Features like delaminations, plowing, abrasive 
wear tracks and some wear debris, which are characteristics of dry sliding wear, are clearly visible. The worn surface 
in the vicinity of the grooves re-includes relatively undisturbed. As the load increases, the formation of oxide and 
delamination also increases. Loss of continuity and occurred progressivelydamage, especially at high loads, on the 
surface caused an increase in wear loss.Fig. 6. SEM morphologies of worn surfaces of CoCuFeNiMo high entropy alloy

at room temperature. The Ecorr curves of the alloys in 3.5wt% NaCl solution at 0.616V are illustrated in Fig. 7.The 
self-corrosion current density on the CoCuFeNiMo gradually stabilizes, considerable extent. The reason for the 
formation of pitting corrosion is the attack of Cl ions. Some pitting pits with a size of approximately 4 μm were 
seen in corrosion properties of the high-entropy alloy. The corrosion corrosion of high entropy alloys in the 
literature was localized in both image modes. The study was conducted to evaluate the structural, wear, and corrosion 
properties.Small cavities are formed at inhomogeneous grain phases and slightly a (µ) phase. These small cavities 
gradually grew and merged with other were observed under a 50N load. As a result, nonuniform corrosion eventually 
resulted. This and 1.211 × 10(cid:0) 4 mm3/N.m at 50N.Microstructure, hardness and tensile properties of as-cast
