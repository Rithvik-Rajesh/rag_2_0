Journal of Alloys and Compounds 988(2024)174335.CoCrFeMnNi alloy is FCC single Cr in the passivation film. Single-phase Interstitial atoms C, N, and B greatly affect the solution and precipitate. The atomic radius of C is less. than 0.1 nm, which can directly enter the lattice gap and improve the. corrosion resistance.nical properties of the alloy by grain refining or precipitation can lead to other corrosion behavior. Different element ratios also affect the corrosion FCC phase and M7C3 carbide (or M23C6 carbide) phase. It is found that the addition of an appropriate amount of C has a backscatter diffraction (EBSD, OXFORD NordlysNao) further examined.There is much research on C atoms in HEAs. In acidic reference electrode. In alkaline solutions, the addition of C has a positive effect on the alloys. After reaching the steady state, EIS was carried out in the fre-behavior of CoCrFeMnNi alloy in a neutral corrosion solution. The voltage scanning range of the. potentiodynamic polarization test was (cid:0) 0.5 - +0.5 (vs. OCP), and the. scanning rate was 0. 5 mV/s. It was immersed in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution without stirring for 2 h. After. adding the C soaking, the samples were tested by open circuit potential (OCP) for the. influence mechanism of C on the corrosion 1800 s.High-purity metal Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni particles with a purity of 3.99 wt% were used as raw mate-riveals. Alloys were immersed in the effect of C on the microstructure evolution of CoCrFeMnNi lution for 30 d under natural ventilation. The composition of the corrosion product was analyzed through Raman spectroscopy.The phase composition of the as-cast and annealed HEAs was analyzed morphology. The alloys were polished with 400 #, 800 #, 1000 #, and 2000# influence on the microstructure of the alloy. The slightly larger dendrite spacing observed in the HEAs suggests that the increased carbon content has an impact on the nucleation and growth behavior of the dendrites.After annealing at 800 ◦C, the microstructure of the C00 alloy derwent significant changes. In the C02 alloy, consisting of a higher carbon content, the driving en-                C08 0.8 0.173 0.192                ergy for grain growth increases. As a result, the grains grow into long                2F.of HEAs. A 20 kV accelerating voltage and 15 mm working in the C08 alloy, compared to the C 00 alloy, could be attributed to the presence of carbon in solid solution, which may affect dendrite growth. Overall, these observations provide insights into the micro-Table 1 of the as-cast and annealed CoCrFeMnNiCx alloys.After annealing at 1000◦C, further changes are observed in the mi- solved in the FCC matrix phase. This shift suggests that the presence of more carbon atoms results in dense dots. The carbides within the grains appear as detected in the C04 and C08 alloys. In the as-cast alloys, no carbide peak was detected when 0.8at% C was added. This observation is consistent with Ref. [24,32]. Interestingly, the average size of the carbides is larger than alloy, indicating the significant influence of the alloy.XRD patterns of the CoCrFeMnNiCx HEA.ing temperature on carbide formation.

It is concluded that the precipitated phase is M7C3 carbide. The size of the carbides appears to be closely related to the carbon content. The anode region represents the shattered point-like distribution in the C04 alloy (Fig. 3a) and strip-like dissolution process of the working electrode in C08 alloy.The as-cast C04 alloy demonstrated the lowest dimensional passiv-                3.1.

The corrosion current density corresponding to (cid:0) 0.25VSCEelements are enriched in the interdendritic regions. The Ep-Ecorr value, representing the influence of carbides and microstructure, was higher in the C08 alloy.he C08 alloy consists of FCC grains annealing treatment improves the pit nucleation resistance. The FCC grains do not exhibit a resistance, was found to be the lowest for the as-cast C04 alloy among all alloys. Most grains exhibit results.subtle color variations, indicating differences in sub-grain orientations.As seen from Fig. 4d, the regions with sub- appearing as black lines under metallographic microscopy. For the as-crystals and precipitates within the grains have a higher degree of cast C00 alloy (Fig. 6a), numerous non-uniformly distributed pitting. pits can be observed, and the corroded grain boundaries display a corroded morphology.The as-cast C04 alloy, with an appropriate carbon content of 0.2at% and CoCrFeMnNi HEA with different carbon contents in 3.5wt% NaCl solution, shows the largest arc radius, indicating the highest corrosion potential. This suggests that adding a suitable amount of carbon can effectively enhance the alloy’s corrosion resis- southeasternVSCE cm(cid:0)2 VSCE cm() resistance. On the other hand, the corrosion resistance of the as- cast C08. alloy decreases due to galvanic corrosion induced by the precipitation of. numerous carbides.C-alloyed CoCrFeMnNi alloys are similar to that of C-free alloys. However, the dendrites in the as-cast C08 alloy are thicker, and the intergranular corrosion phenomenon is more pronounced. In some areas, the corrosion is severe, with corrosion prod-ishly.The corrosion resistance of 1.                the annealed C04 alloy is superior to that of the as-cast C04. alloy. This is consistent with the grain                impedance of CPE (ZCPE) can be calculated by Eq. (1):                boundaries distribution observed in Fig. 1. The EEC model used in Ref [6] is employed to fit the charge transfer process and interfacial electrochemical reactions the EIS results under OCP conditions. The fitting that control the corrosion on their surfaces is found to be satisfactory.C04 alloy among the as-cast alloys exhibits the the C00 and C08 alloys exhibit more severe pitting corrosion. Based on the surface morphology analysis presented in Fig. 6, the presence of defective passive films on the alloy is indicated by the values of n, which are lower than 1 for all corrosion behavior of the alloys. Higher Rct values correspond to slower corrosion rates [46], intergranular corrosion and pitting.The as-cast alloys with different carbon contents the underlying matrix were immersed in 3.5wt% NaCl solution for 30 days. The surface morphology of on the surface of these alloys is relatively uniform, but it cannot provide a complete understanding of the phase types of the corrosion products. Different phases can be indexed in Raman spectra (Fig. 9) according to different phases of corrosion.The alloys exhibittypical dendritic structures as shown in Fig. 1. The presence of nonparallel dendrite arms in all alloys can be attributed to component supercooling. The alloys have a higher tendency to form FCC solid solutions rather than intermetallic compounds during thesolidification process.In the as-cast C04 alloy, the secondary dendrites are of similar length to the dendrite loy’s microstructure. The CoCrFeMnNiCx alloys have a strong tendency for galvanic corrosion. Corrosion around carbides can either be due to galvanic. corrosion or due to a Cr-depletion of                segregate at grain boundaries.C content in the matrix de- surface is covered with numerous corrosion products. The high dislocation density at the grain boundaries and dendrites is denser, improving the protective performance of the matrix. Although carbide precipitation is observed in the C04 alloy annealed at 1000◦C, its corrosion resistance is still the highest. This can be attributed to the pinning effect on grain boundary movement, inhibiting to the unstable subcrystalline structure.Low-angle grain analysis boundaries (LAGB) are more prone to significant dislocation. Abundant grain boundaries provide nucleation. channels for ion dissolution and diffusion. Pitting pits may arise from the loss of some carbides from the cathode, while the dendrite with a lower electrode potential be- matrix in rapidly dissolving regions.
