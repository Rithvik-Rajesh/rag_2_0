Zhilin Zhanga, Jianhui Yuana, Gangjie Lianc, Sue Rend, Yanfang Due, Rui Chenf, Wenbin Youb,*, Renchao Cheb,c,**aSchool of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai University of Engineering Science Shanghai, 201620, China.FeCoNi alloy powder shows an effectiveabsorption band of 7 GHz in the high frequency electromagnetic wave range. It has a high temperature magnetism (Tc >900 K) and excellent corrosion resistance. Doping of Cu to form a quaternary alloy can improve the corrosion resistance and maintain the original wave-absorbing properties. It is increasingly important to find electro-magnetic absorber (EMA) with excellent performance.Corrosion resistance, and it is often difficult to achieve the original mi- 900 K or more allows it to maintain wave-absorbing properties in practical applications. By doping trace Cu into the FeCoNi lattice, the corrosion resistance is further strengthened compared with single element metals. High-entropy alloys inhibit correspond to the microwave absorption requirements of different fre-                the formation of intermetallic compounds due to lattice distortion, thus quency bands. In addition, the resistivity of the alloyed material is higher than single elements.Nano-sized magnetic metal drate (CoSO4⋅7 H2O), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2 ⋅6H2O) are required for medium and high entropy magnetic alloys hydroxide (NaOH), copper sulfate anhydrous (CuSO4) and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate. Three binary alloys, FeCo, CoNi, and FeNi, were prepared by liquid phase. This method can be widely used for the prep-                aration of magnetic metal alloy powders, and the powder particles have a uniform particle size distribution.The alloy particles produced in this paper are all on NaOH. NaOH was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water and mixed with 45 mL of N2H4 •H2O. The alloy powder has excellent corrosion in the agitation for 24 hours. The Fe5Co4Ni alloy powder was synthesized by a similar method, and field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) was used to observe the micromorphology of the sample.Samples were cleaned three times each with deionized magnetic field of 100 Oe and at temperatures of 350–1000 K. Corrosion tests are based on salt water immersion experiments and electrochemical tests. Fe5Co4 was prepared in total by adjusting the addition of NiCl2⋅6 H2O.Fig. 1 shows the preparation process of the samples in this paper by cipitate. A mixed solution of NaOH and hydrazine hydrate was used in the experiment to reduce the metal ions in solution. The synthesis of FeCoNi is smaller than the solubility product constant of Fe(OH)2 and Co( OH)2. It was incorporated into CuSO4 solution for substitution nanoparticles with FCC structure were grown with Ni as the core. The process involves the formation of Fe, Co, and Ni hydroxides, then it was tends to form Ni(oh)2 solid state.XRD patterns of FeCo, CoNi and FeNi binary Fe5Co4Nix (x = 0.25, 0.5,0.75,1,1.5) alloy powders were pre-assembled. CoNi, FeNi have similar XRD patterns, in FeCo are able to correspond neatly. Since the concentration of Ni ions in the solution is now much lower than that of Fe and Co ions, it is still preferred that the hydroxides ofFe and Co are formed first, and then the FeNiand FeNi3 (PDF#65–3244), respectively. It can be concluded that the reduced products of the FeCo crystal structure are obtained.Nano alloy powders (N5) are not completely displaced or encapsu- alloy. They enter the crystal structure to form an alloy when they are displaced in a metal salt. Electromagnetic properties and wave absorption performance are improved with backward metal activity. Microscopic morphology of N2, N5 and N7 complex permittivity (real part and imaginary part) and complex elongation.The addition of a small amount of Ni can make the original irregular FeCo particles have a spherical shape. The degree of impedance matching can generally be determined from the degree of Ni content. FeCoNiCu is slightly enhanced, probably due to the high electrical conduction.generated by polarization relaxation in the range of 2–8GHz, and the conductivity of Cu. The dielectric permittivity and permeability of the doping content of Ni affects the strength of thedielectric loss. N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, and N7 all show a signif- cially in the permeability. The strongest RL reaches 58GHz at a thickness of 2mm (Fig. 6c), and the strongest EAB of 7GHz with thickness of 1.5mm.The magnetization strength of N5 and Cu-doped FeCoNiCu was of several powders after 6 months of immersion in salt water. High temperature magnetism and corrosion resistance solution was used to simulate the concentration of seawater and the samples were soaked at normal temperature. The magnetic loss of the alloy gradually changes from ferromag- change (Fig. 6d)FeCoNiCu alloy has a Curie temperature of 940K, enabling it to maintain magnetism. FeSiAl and CI all incurred large areas of corrosion, but the N5 prepared sample shows only a little sign of corrosion. The magnetization corrosion potential determines whether corrosion starts to occur, and the strength of FeCo NiCu is higher than that of N5.FeCo- FeCoNiCu has a larger capacitive arc radius. N5 has relatively excellent corrosion resistance. The addition of Ni to binary FeCo alloys allows. the formation of regularly shaped spheres with dimensions of about L. Hardell, P. Heroux, E.

The quaternary alloy (FeCoNiCu) has superior corrosion MXene and conducting polymer matrix composites.
