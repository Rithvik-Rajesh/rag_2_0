        "text": "What is the key finding about Mo addition to FeCoNiCrMox HEA coatings?",
        "answer": "Mo addition can significantly enhance the wear and corrosion resistances of FeCoNiCrMox HEA coatings prepared using laser powder directed energy deposition."
    },
    "Q2": {
        "text": "How does Mo addition affect the corrosion resistance of CoCrFeNiTa HEAs?",
        "answer": "The addition of Mo reduces the corrosion rate by more than 50% compared to the unalloyed material."
    },
    "Q3": {
        "text": "What is the role of Mo in enhancing the corrosion resistance of HEAs?",
        "answer": "Mo forms a rich oxide layer on the surface, providing excellent protection against corrosion and wear."
    },
    "Q4": {
        "text": "Can Cr addition also enhance the corrosion resistance of HEAs?",
        "answer": "Yes, one study found that the amount of Cr present significantly affects the corrosion behavior of AlCrFeNi2Cu1.6 HEAs."
    },
    "Q5": {
        "text": "How does Mo addition affect the passivation behavior of CoCrFeNiMox (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) HEAs and MP35N?",
        "answer": "The addition of Mo improves the passivation behavior."
